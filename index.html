          Quantum Computing (QC) is a computation paradigm that leverages the peculiar properties of quantum mechanics 
          such as superposition and entanglement. Several QC paradigms exist  but the two principal ones would be the 
          gate-based and the adiabatic one. The first one describes the computation as quantum circuits that acts on the
          qubits using some set of quantum gates, while the second paradigm is based on the adiabatic theorem in order to
           solve discrete optimisation problems. Each of the paradigms has some advantages and shortfalls and a range of 
           applicability, where a plethora of perspectives rises. <br> <br>

          QC has a wide domain of applications but one of the principal and most promising is optimisation-problem solving,
           where QC algorithms are proven to provide, in some cases, very promising theoretical and practical speedup regarding
            the classical computation techniques. On the other hand, classical Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques  
            (e.g. Evolutionary Computation (EC), unsupervised/supervised machine learning, etc.) are also proven to be a promising
             alternative for certain classes of tasks as well. Thus, it is widely believed that QC will not replace classical 
             computation but instead will collaboratively work together taking profit from one another strengths. Indeed, efforts 
             in the community are made to enhance classical AI methods using quantum routines, or on the reverse enhance quantum 
             processes using classical AI and ultimately, design efficient fully-quantum, hybrid quantum-classical or quantum-inspired AI techniques. 
             In this same line of thoughts, this special session explores how QC can take profit from classical AI especially EC, and vice versa, 
             where the topics include but are not limited to:
